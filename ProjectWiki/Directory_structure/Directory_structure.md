The structure of the directory system of the developer log is pretty simple. The developer log is located inside:

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/`

This is the root of the developer log, and it contains all necessary files. If you want to view separate entries, you go to this path:

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/Entries/`

Inside this folder in the root is entries of the developer log in HTML format. There are 17 subdirectories that each host a certain type of file. All of them just contain the files in formats except for the 3 ZIP folders:  `ZIP6`, `ZIP8`, `ZIP14`

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/Entries/ZIP8/`

Currently, ZIP6 and ZIP14 aren't used. Inside of the root of ZIP8, there are zip files, and a sub directory titled `SEPARATE_FILES`

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/Entries/ZIP8/SEPARATE_FILES/`

This folder contains all the files that were used to make the ZIP files.

That is how the directory structure for this project works.
