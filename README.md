# SNU_2D_DeveloperLog
The official developer log for SNU in 2D mode. It documents changes made to the site, but doesn't list the changes as commits. Developer log entries are also embedded into the update log, but not always entirely. They are 2 separate logs.

# About

The SNU Developer log is an information log that documents the website on a daily basis, and also explains the creators personal life and certain technical opinions for the day. It is separate from the update log, but also is embedded partially into modern update log entries.

The developer log is one of the oldest logs on SNU, which goes back to the beginning of 3.x development, with version 3.0.0.

# Current issues

There are currently 3 issues for this project:

## Truncation issue (GitHub version only)

When uploading entries to the root of the entries folder, GitHub truncated the directory down to 1000 files, removing several directories and files. I now know that there is a 1000 file limit on directories. I am getting more and more disappointed with GitHub for more of these issues that I come across. To combat this issue until either GitHub improves or I find a better repository system, I split the entry system from 1 directory to 4 directories, with 4 subdirectories each (except for entries4, which only has 1 subdirectory)

## Not all entries are exported

I only started doing the separate entry system officially since February 28th 2020. I tried it before but I only was able to do it for 13 days. February 27th 2020 and below do not have separate versions of entries, and many entries don't have formats that are all the way exported in (example: not all ZIP files, no MOBI, DOT, DOCM, XML, XPS, FODT, Zip6x, Zip14x) however, all HTML versions exist

## Resources folder unusable

The resources folder was a test with SNU 3.0.5, where I tried to keep resource files in separate folders. It did not work out, and the directory was abandoned.

# Structure

The structure of the directory system of the developer log is pretty simple. The developer log is located inside:

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/`

This is the root of the developer log, and it contains all necessary files. If you want to view separate entries, you go to this path:

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/Entries/`

Inside this folder in the root is entries of the developer log in HTML format. There are 17 subdirectories that each host a certain type of file. All of them just contain the files in formats except for the 3 ZIP folders:  `ZIP6`, `ZIP8`, `ZIP14`

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/Entries/ZIP8/`

Currently, ZIP6 and ZIP14 aren't used. Inside of the root of ZIP8, there are zip files, and a sub directory titled `SEPARATE_FILES`

> `//2D/Users/Template Acc/Entries/ZIP8/SEPARATE_FILES/`

This folder contains all the files that were used to make the ZIP files.

That is how the directory structure for this project works.
